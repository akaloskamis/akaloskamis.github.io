I am a Geographical Information Systems graduate with an MSc degree from the University of Aberdeen, experienced with Python, SQL and R programming, and a strong interest in Data Analytics, looking to secure a Junior Data Analyst  or GIS Analyst position to use and further develop my analytical skills and knowledge in a practical and fast-paced environment. My career goal is to assume a role which allows me to take responsibility for the data analysis and interpretation for a well-respected and market-leading company.
