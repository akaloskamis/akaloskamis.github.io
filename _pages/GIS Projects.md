# Heads-Up Digitization of the Cruickshank Botanic Garden in Aberdeen, UK.

## Description
Traffic accidents constitute one of the dominant causes of death globally, influencing the welfare of modern society significantly. Aberdeen City is considered as one of the most traffic-congested cities in the UK, resulting in more than 180 incidents per year for the last 10-year period. The purpose of this study is to perform an accidents cluster analysis in the City of Aberdeen by examining both time and space aspects in relation to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response time. Performing network cluster analysis, new space-time accident hot spots are detected on the road network and then a composite examination between those hot spots and the EMS response time is performed.

Throughout the performed analysis and examination of the traffic accident data, some new accident trends have been identified, during the last few years. Moreover, a high density of accidents takes place during specific day hours and months. Finally, most of the hot spots are located within the boundaries of the HEAT standard of 8 minutes, constituting the EMS station ideally situated. However, an emphasis should be given on those hot spots located farther than the 8-minutes zones, and further policies should be deployed against those prone areas.
